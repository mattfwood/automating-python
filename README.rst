## What is the topic?

Basic automation examples using Python

## Why is it important / what problems is it solving?

Python is an approachable, powerful language for automating daily processes and can be helpful for making repetitive tasks simpler.

(Paraphrased from Kent C. Dodds):

Humans are bad at performing repetitive tasks very quickly, while computers are extremely good at it.

If you find yourself doing a repetitive task many times, it can be worth it to automate it. This can help by:

- Reducing areas for mistakes while doing the repetitive task
- Help productivity by not getting bogged down in non-creative tasks
- Making you feel powerful

- Small sharp tools

# Outline

- Creating a project
    - Use [Poetry, a python dependency manager](https://python-poetry.org/)
    - Follow the install instructions and run `poetry new .` in the directory for your project

Poetry (hopefully) helps us avoid this famous Python problem

## Examples
